My repo for the custom commands I run when I stream. I use the deck board app with OBS.


## My Stream Timer
---
I use My Stream Timer by [James Montemagno](https://twitter.com/JamesMontemagno). I do not own an Elgato Stream Deck to configure it to launch on my streams. So I created an app extension that launches and initiates My Stream Timer. Download My Stream Timer through this [link](http://www.mystreamtimer.com/).

I use Deckboard for managing my stream deck. You can find the download link [here](https://deckboard.app/).

After installing My Stream Timer and the extension from [here](installers\streamtimerextension.installer.msi).

Below I show an example of how I configured it to launch My Stream Timer with Top of the Hour countdown argument.

`mystreamtimer://countdown/?topofhour`

You can then launch from your mobile app and it pops up like seen below
